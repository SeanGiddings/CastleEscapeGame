## Tips and Tricks to Get Started

1. At any time, type HELP to bring up a list of all the commands that can be used in the game.
1. Whenever in a new location, begin by typing LOOK. This will let you see what can be used around you.
1. Any words that appear RED can be used with the USE command.
1. You can see what you are carrying at any time by typing INV. All of those items are usable, too.
1. You can return to previously visited locations. Perhaps you have picked up an item that gives you a new option?
